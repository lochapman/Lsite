 <p>The Dungeons and Dragons alignment system works like this:</p>
        <div class="alignment">
            <div class="align">Lawful good</div>
    <div class="align">Neutral good</div>
            <div class="align">Chaotic good</div>
            <div class="align">Lawful neutral</div>
            <div class="align">True neutral</div>
            <div class="align">Chaotic neutral</div>
            <div class="align">Lawful evil</div>
            <div class="align">Neutral evil</div>
            <div class="align">Chaotic evil</div>
        </div>
    <p>These alignments are how morality is determined in D&D, though the definition of 'evil' and 'good' varies, since 'good' is defined as prioritizing the needs of others first, and 'evil' is defined as prioritizing the needs of yourself first.</p>
    <p>As an example; a Hobgoblin is Lawful evil because of their glory seeking ideals and rigid societal norms, while a Storm giant is chaotic good because of their views of responsibility and non-recognition of higher authority</p>
